# Estimating Global Calcite Production with Abil.py

## Overview

Abil.py provides functions to interpolate distributions of biogeochemical observations using Machine Learning algorithms in Python. The library is optimized to interpolate many predictions in parallel and is thus particularly suited for distribution models of species, genes and transcripts. The library relies on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=3.7 recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Install via pip
Run the following command to install the package directly from GitHub:
```sh
pip install abil
```

## Documentation

See the [ Abil.py documentation](https://nanophyto.github.io/Abil/) for instructions on how to setup and run the models.
